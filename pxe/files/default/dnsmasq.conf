# Uncomment this to enable the integrated DHCP server, you need
# to supply the range of addresses available for lease and optionally
# a lease time. If you have more than one network, you will need to
# repeat this for each network on which you want to supply DHCP
# service.

# Ignore any clients which are specified in dhcp-host lines
# or /etc/ethers. Equivalent to ISC "deny unkown-clients".
# This relies on the special "known" tag which is set when
# a host is matched.
#dhcp-ignore=#known

# If this line is uncommented, dnsmasq will read /etc/ethers and act
# on the ethernet-address/IP pairs found there just as if they had
# been given as --dhcp-host options. Useful if you keep
# MAC-address/host mappings there for other purposes.
